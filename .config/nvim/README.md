# Notes on NeoVim config

* ~~Setup LSP, test it~~
* Finish keymaps: comment-uncomment, swap lines, LSP shortcuts, etc.
* Install nerd-tree plugin, git-plugin, autocompletion plugin, snippet plugin,
* Setup spellcheck
* Configure formatter with formatter.nvim (address mason readme-page, there is something about null-ls)
* Install and configure telescpope-undo, trouble.nvim, spectre, flit, whichkey, illuminate, todo-comments
* Move all plugin-related keymappings to plugin specs: keys = {} NOTE: seems like it's not the best idea, gues it's more suitable only for lazy invokation
* Check out flash.nvim, leap.nvim, flit.nvim and others for quick jumps on a screen
